Nonfarm payrolls added just 22,000 positions in August against forecasts of 75,000, while unemployment ticked up to 4.3%, the highest since 2021. It helped push the odds of a rate cut up to 90%.BTC rose to a seven-day high of US$116K, supported by steady ETF inflows and anticipation of a likely rate cut. ETH held flat at $4.3K, before climbing to $4.5K, as data showed ETH reserves on exchanges plunging to a low. The common belief is that a move off exchanges may point to a decision to hold assets for a longer period. The greater push came from alts: In particular, DOGE rallied more than 22% to reach a seven-day high of $0.26, with momentum potentially aided by Rex-Osprey’s launching of the first Dogecoin ETF. The possibility of ‘altszn’ also intensified with the SOL’s rise to $237, a high not seen since seven months ago. It was reported that Nasdaq-listed Forward Industries kickstarted a $1.65 billion Solana Treasury plan.U.S. spot BTC ETFs pulled in $124M over the past five sessions — down from $441M the week prior — while spot ETH ETFs swung to a hefty $952M outflow, erasing last week’s inflows.Here are the other big stories out of the crypto mill.Market Spotlight Note: Market prices captured in USD at the time of sending.
