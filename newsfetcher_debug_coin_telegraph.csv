Within hours, the drama spun into a joke token on BNB Chain called “4,” a playful nod to reports that the attacker made off with only about $4,000.Then, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, Binance’s co-founder and former CEO, referenced the incident.That single mention turned a niche gag into a live market signal as attention flooded into a brand-new pool with barely any liquidity.In the rush that followed, one early buyer put about $3,000 worth of BNB (BNB) into “4” and watched it mark up to around $2 million on screen within hours.Did you know? When CZ tweets “4,” he’s referencing point #4 from his 2023 “Do’s & Don’ts” list: Ignore FUD, fake news, attacks, etc. It became a community shorthand long before the 4 memecoin appeared.How a meme turned into a move1. BNB Chain account hijacked (Oct. 1, 2025)BNB Chain’s official X account was compromised and used to post phishing links to roughly 4 million followers. The team later regained control and issued warnings. Out of the chaos came a running joke that the attacker made off with only “$4k.”2. A joke gets a tickerWithin hours, a new token called 4 launched on BNB Chain — a wink at the “$4k” meme. Early buyers began circling a brand-new liquidity pool that was barely funded.3. CZ amplifies itChangpeng “CZ” Zhao referenced the incident to his 10.3 million followers, noting the hacker’s small profit and how the community “bought the memecoin higher.” What began as a joke quickly turned into a live trade signal. Human traders and bots now had a ticker to chase.4. The first wave of orders hitsScanners flagged the contract, copy traders queued buys, and retail flowed through aggregators into the same shallow pool. With wafer-thin depth, each filled order lifted the next quote. Slippage widened, momentum compounded, and the chart turned near-vertical.5. The headline wallet is already inAn address labeled “0x872” bought in early with about $3,000 worth of BNB. As attention flooded the pool and liquidity thinned, that small stake swelled to roughly $2 million within hours.Inside the winning walletThe wallet that grabbed headlines (“0x872”) didn’t look like a mastermind. It put around $3,000 worth of BNB into a freshly minted token and, as attention hit, watched its mark-to-market soar.What turned a modest position into a paper fortune was getting in early on a thin pool. When liquidity is shallow, every new buyer pushes up the next quote you’d sell into — whether you actually sell or not.Then came the moment every speculator both wants and dreads: life-changing numbers on screen with almost no depth underneath.Onchain traces show only light profit-taking. The address kept over 98% of its portfolio in 4, still around $1.88 million after the first spike, maximizing upside if momentum held, but leaving the position exposed if a single decent market sell hit the pool.The screenshots told the same story: roughly $1.8 million in unrealized profit over the week.“Unrealized” is the operative word. Until an order fills, profit and loss (PnL) is just a suggestion. In venues where one sale can move the price several percentage points, even trimming requires intent and a plan. Many traders learn this by round-tripping a win back to par; this wallet, for a time, chose to ride.Flow around the wallet fed the loop. “Smart money” addresses tracked by Lookonchain began buying 4, pushing it into the most accumulated BNB Chain tokens over the next 24 hours.That feedback loop magnified reflexivity. As more screens lit up and copy trades fired, the early holder’s unrealized value kept climbing — until a larger seller finally tested the pool’s depth.0x872’s outcome hinged on two choices: stepping in absurdly early and resisting the immediate urge to cash out.Did you know? 0x872 wasn’t alone. Another wallet had reportedly bought minutes before CZ’s post and was up seven figures within hours — a reminder that fast alerts and feed monitoring can create a real edge in meme-driven bursts.When hype outruns depthSo, what’s in store for the headline wallet? Maximum upside if momentum holds and maximum downside if a single decent sell order hits a shallow pool.But we shouldn’t lose sight of the catalyst: a compromised official account. Spikes like this attract phishers and look-alike contracts. The takeaway is procedural. Verify the contract and the pool size, script an exit in advance and treat screenshots as suggestions until a fill clears.Posts create flow, not value, and the exit door is narrower than it looks.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The trading platform said in an X post, “Around 76% of retail accounts currently hold net long positions on Solana, a threshold that historically aligns with positive forward returns.”Hyblock’s backtest of the signal shows that whenever TRA exceeds 75%, SOL’s seven-day mean and median forward returns rise from around +2.25% to over +5%, while average drawdowns decrease. The analysis added that the risk–reward ratio (RR) nearly doubles during these instances, suggesting stronger follow-through on upward moves and reduced downside volatility.Solana retail long position analysis. Source: Hyblock Capital/XLikewise, crypto analyst Darkfost offered an optimistic outlook, pointing to broader altcoin capitulation as a potential accumulation phase. The trader said that only 10% of Binance-listed altcoins remain above their 200-day moving average, indicating widespread fear and disinterest. Historically, such conditions have preceded notable market rebounds. Darkfost said, “The best time to gain exposure to altcoins is often when no one wants them anymore,” emphasizing that previous cycles saw similar setups resolve in strong short-term recoveries.Percentage of altcoins above the 200D-SMA on Binance. Source: XAt the moment, corporate digital asset treasuries appear to be taking advantage of SOL’s sub-$200 pricing. Solana treasury company Solmate (Nasdaq: SLMT) purchased $50 million worth of SOL from the Solana Foundation at a 15% discount, with ARK Invest disclosing a new 11.5% ownership stake. Solmate had earlier raised $300 million to build its digital asset treasury. Meanwhile, treasury firm SOL Strategies (Nasdaq: STKE) acquired an additional 88,433 SOL, including 79,000 locked SOL from the foundation at an average price of $193.93 per coin, bringing its total holdings to 523,433 SOL. These moves underline coordinated accumulation by institutional players at current price levels.Related: Bitcoin buyers build bids at $105K as crypto market meltdown nears conclusionCan SOL hold a position above $200?While SOL’s long-term outlook remains constructive, its recent dip and daily close below $190 marked the first bearish break of structure since February, signaling a potential shift in momentum on higher time frames. Although SOL briefly reclaimed its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), it now trades between the 50-day and 100-day EMAs. This compression typically reflects indecision, where short-term momentum weakens while medium-term support holds, often preceding a larger directional move.Traders may continue bidding under $200, but a swift recovery could be limited. However, SOL recently retested long-term demand zones from $190 to $170, likely absorbing earlier buy orders during the Oct. 10 flash crash. A continuation might see SOL consolidate to $160 from $200 if the bullish momentum remains underwhelming in the coming days. SOL one-day chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewDespite the short-term bearish setup, market analyst Pelin Ay said that whale order activity on SOL has started increasing again, a trend that has historically preceded rallies of 40%–70%. The analyst said the whales are positioning ahead of the Thursday spot SOL ETF decision, which could catalyze stronger spot demand. Combined with SOL’s high staking ratio and potential inclusion in multiple publicly listed indexes, a favorable ETF outcome could tighten supply and re-establish SOL’s bullish trajectory above $200.

AI can facilitate this, mainly by impacting scalability and transaction processes.As a decentralized system, Bitcoin is not affected by internal politics, whose human element could disrupt its operations. It only has to stay up-to-date with the new tech to remain relevant.Nobody has the means to predict what will happen within the next 50 years, especially not in a financial market that is influenced by so many external factors.However, analyzing the current status of AI and its impact on fintech sectors such as Bitcoin and stocks, it’s possible to understand what would be the best investment choice between these financial tools.The purpose of this article is to help you make more informed decisions and understand if Bitcoin or stocks is a better choice for you in the future.Stocks or Bitcoin: Which will survive the AI revolution?AI will accelerate innovation and efficiency in several industries, sectors and aspects of our lives, surely advancing improvements in tech like Bitcoin in terms of efficiency and, hopefully, scaling. But how about stocks? Is their investment concept a thing of the past? Let’s find out a little bit more.What is the case for stocks?The world’s first stock market took shape in Amsterdam in 1602 with the founding of the Dutch East India Company. What began as a marketplace for trading company shares soon became a model for raising capital and investing. By the late 17th century, London had developed its own trading hubs, while New York’s exchange would not emerge until 1792, spreading the model across the Atlantic.Stocks represent ownership in companies, and the stock market is where investors buy and sell them. Stock values fluctuate based on company performance and market conditions, including the ability to adapt to technological changes like AI.Stocks of businesses that embraced technological advancements over the centuries have survived economic cycles, wars and disruptions that technology brought along. Without the benefit of hindsight, the same seems likely for companies betting on AI.Specifically, companies that apply AI through automation, data analytics and new business models are likely to succeed.Historically, market indexes like the S&P 500 have delivered approximately 7%-10% annualized returns over decades, adjusted for inflation. The index tracks the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded US companies and is widely used as a benchmark for the overall stock market.Compared to the S&P 500, Bitcoin’s (BTC) performance has been exceptionally higher, as shown in the table below:What is the case for Bitcoin?Bitcoin is a relatively new invention, created in 2009 by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto.The project was introduced in a white paper detailing a peer-to-peer electronic cash system using blockchain technology.The case for Bitcoin goes beyond the investment tool or store of value conception. Its proposal includes a true monetary revolution, which challenges gold and other financial tools.Its decentralized design resists central control and the inflation common in fiat systems. With a fixed supply capped at 21 million coins, Bitcoin’s scarcity appeals to those seeking protection against monetary debasement.Furthermore, blockchain’s transparency and security align well with AI’s need for verifiable data.Over the years, Bitcoin has established itself as both a store of value and an alternative currency, while still pursuing its original goal of becoming a widely used medium of exchange.How AI affects stocks and the stock marketThe next 50 years could challenge the survival of the stock market as an institution due to “artificial intelligence speeding up innovation cycles, making public companies inefficient investment vehicles,” as predicted by analyst and investor Jordi Visser.Stocks have been around a long time, but AI-driven disruptions leave little room for complacency, and companies that fail to adjust risk falling behind. This is especially true for tech giants like the FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google). While they are among the biggest investors in AI, these companies will still need to keep pace with rapid developments and adopt them effectively.AI will also have an impact on the stock market, from quickly analyzing huge amounts of data to predicting market movements and automating decision-making processes, for faster and more efficient operations. AI will have an enormous impact on the way investors approach trading and investment strategies.Overall, AI will likely boost corporate innovation but also widen the gap between adaptable and stagnant firms.How AI affects BitcoinVisser sees Bitcoin as a better future investment and compares it to gold, which has endured for thousands of years.Beyond its role as a store of value, Bitcoin is well-placed in the future of finance. The combination of AI and blockchain may disrupt traditional financial systems, bringing more capital and participants into the digital economy.AI is expected to improve Bitcoin security and trading strategies, improving crypto trading through automated tools, enhanced data analysis and market pattern prediction. All these changes may also trigger better system efficiency.Bitcoin mining will also benefit from AI in terms of efficiency and better resource allocation by predicting optimal times for mining activity to reduce costs and maximize output. System maintenance will improve as AI can detect existing or upcoming failures, thereby increasing its overall reliability.However, Bitcoin faces regulatory risks, scalability issues and volatility, which may deter risk-averse investors who generally prefer more predictable and stable investment tools such as stocks.The convergence of AI and blockchain could trigger a new era for Bitcoin, nurturing broader adoption by creating a more intuitive and secure ecosystem, giving it an edge over stagnant stocks.Which will survive the next 50 years?Looking 50 years ahead is practically impossible. Both Bitcoin and stocks have unique strengths and weaknesses, and their future ultimately depends on economic, technological and societal changes.Stocks will likely endure if they adapt to AI-driven economies. Investors can mitigate risks of individual company failures by putting money into diversified portfolios, like index funds, which appear more secure. Stocks in robotics, biotech, space and AI may perform better than less tech-driven assets.The advent of quantum computing is often discussed in relation to Bitcoin’s security model, though most experts agree the risk is still theoretical and distant. Combined with AI, its impact could be positive or negative depending on how the technology evolves and how the Bitcoin network adapts. Mining centralization might also be a concern if only a few entities gain early access to advanced quantum-AI systems.On the other hand, the combination could be advancing Bitcoin security and network optimization by improving transaction processing, wallet security or blockchain analytics, enhancing Bitcoin’s efficiency and user experience. As long as the Bitcoin community stays ahead of the curve with quantum-resistant upgrades, the net impact could be positive.As decentralized finance gains traction in investments, Bitcoin also enhances its competitive edge over gold. By doing so, it is emerging as a superior store of value and encouraging traditional markets to shift funds to digital finance.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

CryptoQuant explains that a high STH ratio implies that newer investors are inheriting the supply from older investors who are taking profit. This includes the largest investor cohort, the whales.“In past cycles, this transfer of dominance from LTH to STH has coincided with the final expansion phase of a bull market,” the post continued. Bitcoin whale realized cap ownership (screenshot).

Over the past few months, DATs have amassed a whopping 5.9 million ETH, worth around $24 billion and equivalent to 4.9% of the total supply, according to StrategicEthReserve. These entities will hold the asset for long-term yields. DATs and ETFs have been hoovering up ETH at record rates this year. Source: StrategicEthReserveSpot Ether exchange-traded funds were also absent in the last cycle. As of today, US-based ETFs have scooped up 6.84 million Ether worth $28 billion, and equivalent to 5.6% of the total supply, despite staking not being approved.  Finally, while staking was in its infancy during the last market cycle, today there is 35.7 million ETH staked, worth approximately $146 billion, and accounting for almost 30% of the entire supply. Most of this is illiquid due to the length of the exit queue, which currently stands at 40 days.  Crypto Gucci stated that Ether has entered this cycle with record institutional demand and the smallest liquid float in its history.“When demand meets a shrinking supply like this, price doesn’t just go up, it goes nuclear.”“With institutional bidding and [ETF] staking approval, I think ETH will rally hard,” said entrepreneur Ted Pillows earlier this week. He predicted a fair value of $8,000 to $10,000 this cycle.Related: Ether ‘3-wave pullback’ to end soon, $5.5K next: FundstratThe Ether supply is marginally inflationary at the moment, but it has only increased by 0.5% since the Merge in 2022, when it transitioned from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, according to Ultrasound.Money. Compared to this, the Bitcoin (BTC) supply has increased by 4% over the same period. Nation-states next? Another factor that could become a fourth supply vacuum would be if nation-states started stockpiling Ether for their crypto strategic reserves.This week, the Kingdom of Bhutan announced that it was building on Ethereum by integrating its national ID system on the blockchain. However, it does not currently hold any ETH.“It’s awesome that Bhutan is building on Ethereum,” said Ryan Sean Adams from Bankless. “But if Ethereum can’t convert building on Ethereum to holding ETH as a store of value, it’ll never live up to its cypherpunk dreams,” he added. Magazine: Bitcoin’s ‘macro whiplash,’ Shuffle suffers data breach: Hodler’s Digest"

When the price drops, your $10 buys more units; when it rises, you buy fewer. Over time, these purchases average out into a single cost basis.DCA won’t protect you from drawdowns if the asset keeps trending lower. In a steadily rising market, a lump-sum investment often performs better. Use DCA as a tool for discipline and automation to help you stay consistent.Why crypto investors use DCACrypto trades 24/7, with sharp moves as likely on a Sunday night as on a Tuesday morning. In such a continuous market, trying to “pick your moment” is mostly guesswork, which is why many investors prefer a rule that removes the need for perfect timing.DCA provides exactly that: You set the asset, amount and frequency, then let the schedule handle the rest. The result is steady exposure without the pressure to react to every market swing.There’s a psychological benefit, too. A simple, pre-set routine helps curb fear of missing out (FOMO) on green days and panic on red ones. Instead of reacting to headlines, you stick to the plan.It’s also easy to set up. Most major exchanges and wallets now offer recurring buy or “Auto-Invest” options: Just choose your coin, select a weekly or monthly schedule and let the orders run automatically.For anyone building a position from regular income, such as salary, freelance payments or side hustles, DCA fits neatly into everyday finances. It also keeps decision-making calm and repeatable.Did you know? Fundstrat analysis suggests that missing just the 10 best Bitcoin days in a year can wipe out most or all of that year’s gains. Timing perfectly isn’t just hard; it’s costly.Case study: El Salvador’s Bitcoin DCA A real-world example: El Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender in 2021 and chose steady accumulation instead of headline-grabbing bets. On Nov. 17, 2022, President Nayib Bukele set a simple rule: buy one Bitcoin every day — a transparent routine anyone can verify.There have been symbolic top-ups. On “Bitcoin Day” in September 2025, Bukele announced a 21-BTC purchase, taking disclosed reserves to about 6,313 BTC.Also, not every coin came from the market; geothermal mining reportedly added around 474 BTC over three years (small in energy terms, but still additive).How has it worked out? During the late-2024-to-mid-2025 rally, media estimates pointed to unrealized gains of $300 million by December 2024, rising to portfolio values north of $700 million months later, implying hundreds of millions in profit at peak. Figures move with price, but the pattern was clear in that upswing: Disciplined buying built a meaningful position.Indeed, a simple, repeatable rule can act both as a policy signal and as an operational habit for long-term accumulation.Did you know? Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) has become the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, reporting 640,000 BTC by late September/early October 2025 — an institutional-scale, rules-driven accumulation story.Common mistakes and risks in DCAEven with a high-profile example, DCA isn’t without drawbacks. The main one is opportunity cost. In a rising market, a lump sum often wins because more of your capital benefits from the gains earlier. Studies in equities show lump-sum investing outperforms cost averaging roughly two-thirds of the time, and the same logic can extend to crypto.Next, fees and friction. Many small orders can increase overall costs. Platforms often add spreads on top of explicit trading fees, and onchain transfers include network fees. If your fee structure penalizes tiny orders, making fewer, larger purchases may be more efficient.There’s also execution and venue risk. Standing orders depend on deposits clearing and automations running smoothly, but outages or delays can disrupt the schedule. Using a centralized platform also exposes you to operational, legal and security risks, so decide carefully how you’ll hold your assets.Behavior matters, too. Averaging into an asset that keeps falling still loses money, and DCA often trails lump-sum investing during strong bull markets.Finally, admin and tax: Frequent buys create multiple lots to track. For example, in the UK, His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) pooling rules require careful record-keeping. Check your local tax guidance before enabling “Auto-Invest.”Did you know? Network fees aren’t constant. Around major events (like the 2024 halving and token-minting frenzies), onchain fees spiked even as prices stabilized, so recurring onchain transfers can cost more at busy times.DCA or lump sum? A side-by-side lookWhen (and when not) to use DCADCA suits people who want steady exposure without trying to time every move. If you’re new, short on time or simply prefer a calm routine, a fixed automatic buy helps you stay invested through the noise.It also works well for anyone earning in fiat who can set aside a small, regular amount instead of committing a lump sum. The real advantage is behavioral: You replace impulse with habit and stop second-guessing every decision.Still, it’s not for everyone. If you’re sitting on a sizable cash pile and comfortable with risk, history shows that putting it to work all at once often performs better in rising markets. And if your style involves short-term trading around catalysts, a slow, calendar-based plan won’t fit your goals.A few guardrails help: Pick an amount you can sustain even during drawdowns; automate but check fees and spreads — if small orders cost more, buy less often in larger amounts; decide in advance how you’ll take profit, rebalance or stop (time-based, target allocation or goal-linked); and make a clear custody plan, whether through an exchange, broker or self-custody, with basic security in place.DCA is a discipline tool that rewards simplicity and consistency over speed. Whether it’s right for you depends on your cash flow, risk tolerance and how much you value a steady, rule-based process.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The kind of event that forces everyone to stop, reprice risk, and rethink what’s actually possible (and broken) in this market.”Near-term volatility is to be expectedThe path to the cycle top is likely to be volatile, HashKey Group senior researcher Tim Sun told Cointelegraph. “Following last weekend’s aggressive deleveraging, sentiment in the cryptocurrency market has yet to fully recover, and overall risk appetite remains subdued. Price action is relatively sensitive to headline-driven catalysts.”“Near-term volatility is to be expected, but excessive pessimism is unwarranted,” he said, adding that from a medium-to-long-term perspective, “policy easing, de-escalation of tensions, and liquidity repair should remain the dominant themes.”Seasonal influences remain relevant October gained the moniker “Uptober” as Bitcoin has clocked gains in October in ten of the past 12 years. It is currently down 0.6% since the start of this month, but historical trends suggest it could still turn positive by the end of the month.

And if gold can rally that hard, imagine what happens when capital starts rotating back into Bitcoin.”Other Uptober influences The trade tariff scare that contributed to the weekend crash appears to be waning as a White House official confirmed that President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet to discuss trade.“Trade conflict is not a zero-sum game; both parties ultimately seek larger shares of the gains, suggesting the eventual outcome is likely to be more moderate than current sentiment implies,” said Sun. Other narratives, such as further Federal Reserve rate cuts this year, and the debasement trade, are also fuelling the sentiment that Uptober is still on track. Magazine: Bitcoin’s ‘macro whiplash,’ Shuffle suffers data breach: Hodler’s Digest"

Still, the record $1.73 billion in long liquidations left a lasting mark on SOL’s derivatives market, prompting traders to question whether the bullish momentum has faded and if the token can realistically hit $300 this cycle.SOL perpetual futures funding rate, annualized. Source: Laevitas.chDemand for leveraged bullish positions remains muted, as the perpetual futures funding rate hovers around 0%. Under normal market conditions, this indicator typically ranges between 6% and 12%, showing that longs (buyers) are willing to pay to maintain their exposure. Notably, SOL’s funding rate before Friday’s crash was around 4%, already below the neutral range.When the funding rate turns negative, it generally indicates that shorts (sellers) dominate, though this rarely lasts long due to the cost of maintaining those bets. Even so, the ongoing strain in SOL’s derivatives market likely mirrors the broader damage Friday’s liquidations inflicted across the cryptocurrency sector.Weak Solana network activity amid increased competitionSolana’s onchain metrics reveal a persistent lack of bullish momentum, even with SOL trading 31% below its $295 all-time high from January. Network activity has struggled to regain traction since the memecoin frenzy earlier in 2025, and the blockchain has also lost its lead in decentralized exchanges (DEXs) as new competitors gain market share.Solana weekly network fees and DApps revenue, USD. Source: DefiLlamaDecentralized applications (DApps) on Solana generated $35.9 million in weekly revenue, while network fees totaled $6.5 million, marking a 35% drop from the previous month. This slowdown weakens demand for SOL as the payment token for blockchain computation. Lower activity also reduces staking yields for SOL holders, adding further downside pressure.Blockchains ranked by seven-day fees, USD. Source: NansenIn contrast, competing networks such as BNB Chain, Ethereum and Hyperliquid have seen their fees rise significantly, largely at Solana’s expense. BNB Chain’s impressive $59.1 million in weekly fees highlights the success of four.meme, a memecoin launchpad platform fully integrated with Binance Wallet and positioned as a direct rival to Solana’s Pump.fun.Even if one assumes BNB Chain’s momentum is temporary, fees across the Ethereum ecosystem have surged. Layer-2 scaling networks such as Base, Arbitrum and Polygon each saw weekly fees jump by 40% or more. Uniswap recorded its highest-ever weekly fees at $83.8 million, driven largely by activity on Ethereum and Base. Meanwhile, Hyperliquid also benefited from Friday’s market volatility, posting a notable spike in trading fees.To gauge whether SOL traders have turned bearish, it’s useful to examine the balance between call (buy) and put (sell) options.SOL options put-to-call volume ratio at Deribit. Source: Laevitas.chThe SOL put-to-call volume ratio on Deribit has remained below 90% for the past week, signaling weak demand for neutral or bearish positions. Historically, when traders expect a correction, this metric rises above 180%—a level last reached on Sept. 20, following an 11-day, 26.7% rally in SOL’s price.Related: BNB Chain sees record user activity, transactions up 151% in 30 daysWhile SOL’s derivatives metrics may have been distorted by the volatility from Friday’s flash crash, the ongoing weakness in onchain activity as rival blockchains gain momentum is concerning. The rise of Aster, Hyperliquid and Uniswap has come directly at the expense of Solana’s upside potential.Even if traders are not explicitly bearish on SOL, it is unlikely that a single event, such as the potential approval of spot Solana exchange-traded funds in the United States, would be enough to drive its price to $300 in the near term.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

A move below $105,000 could bring the yearly open at $93,500 back into focus as a longer-term magnet for price. Meanwhile, blockchain analytics company Glassnode said Bitcoin has begun stabilizing after its recent correction, remaining above the 135-day moving average. The analytics platform said the Young Supply MVRV, which measures unrealized profits among short-term holders, has “reset toward 1.0.” This implied that the market has cooled off from speculative extremes, as newer investors are no longer sitting on outsized profits, helping reduce the pressure for further selling.Bitcoin young supply realized price. Source: Glassnode/XGlassnode also said that the current downturn differs from previous capitulation events. Over 90% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply remains in profit, meaning most of the recent losses came from traders who bought near the top. In previous breakdowns, such as the FTX and Terra Luna crashes, less than 65% of supply was profitable, a sign of broader panic. This time, the correction appears to be a leverage-driven event rather than a widespread sell-off.Adding to that perspective, Bitcoin analyst Axel Adler Jr. said the market’s behavior during the latest pullback reflected a mature response to volatility. Spot trading volume surged to around $44 billion, futures volume reached $128 billion and open interest declined by $14 billion, yet only about $1 billion of those positions were forced long liquidations. In other words, Adler seems to believe that roughly 93% of the deleveraging “wasn’t forced,” pointing to a controlled reduction of leverage rather than a cascading liquidation event.Related: Elon Musk touts Bitcoin as energy-based and inflation-proof, unlike ‘fake fiat’Bitcoin bulls eye rally to $117,500, but will they get it?With the market stabilizing, $117,500 is the key resistance level for bullish continuation.

Historically, this trendline has served as a springboard during each correction of the current cycle. If it holds once again, it would suggest that the broader bull market structure remains intact, and the recent drawdown represents a mid-cycle reset rather than the start of a deeper decline.Bitcoin weekly uptrend analysis by Merlijn the Trader.

If ETH hits $100,000, Ethereum will become a multitrillion-dollar economy with outsized knock-on effects.At $100,000 per Ether (ETH), today’s circulating supply of 121.1 million would imply a market value of around $12.1 trillion. That’s about 3.2 times Apple’s market cap and roughly 44% of gold’s estimated total value.If roughly 36 million ETH remains staked (29.5% of supply), that alone represents $3.6 trillion in bonded capital. At this scale, every downstream metric amplifies: from the security budget (via staking rewards) to the US dollar impact of fees and the collateral base supporting decentralized finance (DeFi) and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).This article explores not only how ETH could plausibly reach $100,000 but also what operating an economy of that scale would look like in practice.Did you know? VanEck made the most notable $100,000-plus call. On June 5, 2024, the SEC-regulated asset manager published a 2030 valuation model for Ether, projecting a bull-case price of $154,000 per ETH and a base case of $22,000.     What could push ETH to $100,000?   Six figures likely requires multiple durable drivers compounding at once.A steady institutional bid: Spot ETH funds have already shown they can attract serious money. If allocations broaden from crypto desks to pensions, wealth managers and retirement accounts, those creations become a slow, mechanical tide that soaks up supply.Onchain dollars at scale: Stablecoins are near record highs around $300 billion, and tokenized US T-bill funds have moved from pilots to real collateral. BlackRock’s BUIDL sits in the low-$3-billion range, while VBILL and other products are live. More day-to-day settlement and collateral living on Ethereum and its rollups deepen liquidity and push more fees (and burn) through the system.Scaling that keeps costs low while ETH still captures value: The Dencun upgrade made it cheaper for rollups to publish data through blob transactions, keeping user costs on layer 2s (L2s) in the cents range. Crucially, rollups still settle to Ethereum in ETH, and blob-based fees are burned. Activity can move up the stack without cutting Ethereum — or its value capture — out of the loop.Scarcity mechanics: Staked ETH has crossed 36 million (29% of the supply), further tightening the tradable float. Restaking is already a meaningful capital layer with the potential to lock in yet more liquidity. When you add in sustained fee burn, that means inflows start hitting a thinner float — a classic reflexivity loop.Macro and expectations: Street baselines remain much lower, with most forecasts ranging between $7,500 and $25,000 for the 2025-2028 window and a $22,000 base case by 2030. Reaching six figures would likely require a perfect mix of conditions: hundreds of billions in ETF assets under management (AUM), several trillion dollars in onchain money and tokenization with Ethereum maintaining its share and fee burn consistently offsetting issuance during a friendly liquidity cycle.For ETH, a single upgrade or brief speculative burst won’t do the job on its own. The real signal appears when steady trends line up. It’s seen in consistent ETF inflows and the growing use of stablecoins and tokenized funds on Ethereum and its L2s. Strong L2 throughput and burn add to that strength, along with wider participation through staking and restaking.     ETH network economics at $100,000   At six figures, even small percentage shifts in the protocol translate into massive dollar flows — and that’s what ultimately funds network security.Ethereum’s proof-of-stake ties issuance to the share of ETH securing the network. As more ETH is staked, the reward rate per validator falls, allowing security to scale without excessive inflation. At $100,000 per ETH, the real headline will be the USD value of those rewards.Think in simple units. The USD security budget equals ETH issued per year x ETH price. At $100,000 per ETH:100,000 ETH issued annually → $10 billion300,000 ETH → $30 billion1 million ETH → $100 billion.These dollars come alongside priority fees and maximal extractable value (MEV) from block production.As onchain activity expands, those revenue streams grow in USD terms, too, attracting more validators and gradually compressing percentage yields, even as the total dollar payouts continue to rise.On the other side of the ledger, Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 burns the base fee (and, post-Dencun, blob fees) every block. Heavier usage increases the burn. Whether net supply is inflationary or deflationary at six figures depends on the issuance vs. burn balance (i.e., how much block space users consume on L1 and L2s).Staking also shapes liquidity. A larger staked share tightens the tradable float and routes more activity through liquid staking tokens (LSTs) and restaking layers. That’s capital-efficient, but risk concentrates: Operator dominance, correlated slashing and exit-queue dynamics matter more when trillions are at stake.Ultimately, issuance that felt modest in ETH terms becomes tens of billions of security spent; a burn that seemed incremental can offset a meaningful slice of it. The mix between direct staking, LSTs and restaking becomes a first-order driver of both security and market liquidity.Did you know? When we say “USD security budget,” we’re referring to the total dollar value Ethereum spends each year compensating validators for securing the network.     How Ethereum stays usable at $100,000   Users will only tolerate six-figure ETH if everyday transactions stay cheap and the network keeps capturing value.At $100,000, gas fees on L1 convert into much higher USD fees. Dencun is the pressure valve: Rollups publish blob data far more cheaply, so routine activity lives on L2 for cents, while rollups still settle to Ethereum and pay in ETH to do it.The fee burn is still there, but it’s been rerouted. L1 still burns the base fee, and blob fees burn as well, so ETH is destroyed as usage scales.Six figures only hold if real users keep transacting. Cheap L2s keep retail and business flows active; L1 settlement and blobs keep ETH at the center and the burn running. That combination sustains demand (infrastructure spend in ETH) and tightens supply (through burn) — the kind of feedback loop a high valuation needs to be durable.Indeed, affordable L2s protect user experience, while L1/L2 value capture (fees paid in ETH, ongoing burn) supports the asset. Without both, activity would migrate or stall, undercutting the very demand that a $100,000 ETH requires.     Where the six-figure flows come from: ETFs, DeFi, stablecoins, collateral   At $100,000, it’s who’s buying — and how — that defines the market regime, not the headlines.ETFs as the structural bid: Spot funds turn portfolio rebalancing and retirement contributions into predictable creations rather than hype spikes. Most wrappers don’t stake, so a healthy float stays on exchanges for price discovery even as protocol-level staking reduces tradable supply. That balance — steady net-buy from funds plus adequate liquidity for sellers — can turn sharp rallies into durable uptrends.DeFi’s mechanical lift (and sharper edges): When prices rise, collateral values expand, borrowing capacity increases and protocol revenues climb through higher fees and MEV sharing. But the risks scale, too: Liquidation bands widen, risk parameters tighten and oracles face more strain when markets move fast.Stablecoins as the settlement layer: Stablecoins power most everyday onchain payments and transfers. As their supply and velocity expand across Ethereum and its rollups, market liquidity deepens while users continue paying low L2-level fees. Rollups pay ETH to post data and settle on L1. This keeps ETH at the center of settlement and ensures that demand remains strong even as most activity shifts above the base layer.ETFs provide a steady, structural bid, while stablecoins and DeFi generate continuous economic activity. Together, they support a six-figure valuation from both sides: persistent buying pressure from funds and an active network that consistently consumes and burns ETH.     What could derail $100,000: Second-order effects and the resilience checklist   Large valuations amplify everything: volatility, regulatory scrutiny and operational weak points.Faster cascades, thinner pockets: With size comes higher volatility and leverage. Liquidations can cascade faster across L2s and bridges, and thin liquidity pockets bite harder.Tighter policy perimeter: Expect closer supervision of staking, liquid staking and restaking, ETF disclosures and consumer apps. Missteps here can dent flows or force structural changes.Centralization and shared dependencies: Validator concentration, single-operator sequencers and shared custody/oracle dependencies move from housekeeping to systemic risk at scale.UX split and security bar raise: Day-to-day activity gravitates toward L2s, driven by account abstraction and sponsored gas, while L1 remains reserved for high-value settlement. Larger dollar rewards inevitably attract more capable adversaries, making client diversity, MEV market design and credible fault or escape proofs non-negotiable.If we’re talking about what keeps $100,000 sustainable, it comes down to operator diversity, healthy exit queues, conservative risk parameters, robust clients and reliable oracles — the very signals large allocators track. When those indicators align with ETF inflows and steady onchain growth, $100,000 stops sounding like a “maybe.”"

Volume bars below the chart help confirm market participation.Candlestick charts remain the most popular for their detail, while line charts offer quick overviews, and bar charts provide an alternative OHLC breakdown.Common patterns such as head and shoulders, double tops and bottoms, triangles, flags, pennants and wedges capture trader sentiment and help forecast potential reversals or continuations.In 2025, crypto remains a mix of opportunity and challenge. Prices continue to fluctuate as fresh regulations, new tech and AI trends influence how the market moves.For beginners, the market can feel overwhelming, but once you learn how to read crypto charts, the chaos starts to make sense.This article explains how to read crypto charts by breaking down essential patterns, tools and techniques. Whether you’re trying to anticipate Bitcoin’s (BTC) next move or explore upcoming altcoin rallies, you’ll gain practical skills to interpret price action. With a clear, step-by-step approach, it helps you build a solid foundation for crypto trading and avoid common mistakes.Crypto chart fundamentalsCrypto price charts visually represent price movements across different timeframes, providing insights into trends, volatility and trading opportunities. In a fast-paced crypto market, open-high-low-close (OHLC) data enables investors to track price changes within specific periods, forming the core of technical analysis.Key componentsUnderstanding the structure of crypto charts is essential for traders. Main components of crypto charts include:X-axis: Multi-timeframe analysis is key to balancing short-term trades with a long-term outlook. You can adjust charts from one-minute to monthly intervals.Y-axis: The price scale can be set to linear or logarithmic. A logarithmic scale is more useful for long-term crypto analysis because it highlights percentage-based changes more clearly.Volume bars: These show market activity and help confirm chart patterns by indicating whether a breakout or reversal is backed by strong trading participation.Foundational chart types Some chart types form the foundation of technical analysis. The most common ones include:Candlestick: The most widely used chart type, showing OHLC data within a single bar.Line: Offers a quick view of overall trends by connecting closing prices over time.Bar: An alternative to candlesticks that also displays the OHLC structure in a simpler format.With the rise of AI, charts that integrate onchain data, such as wallet activity and total value locked (TVL), are becoming increasingly popular. These advanced charts give traders deeper insights into evolving market dynamics.Did you know? Candlestick charts originated in 18th-century Japan, where they were first used to track rice trading, long before making their way into modern crypto markets.Five most popular chart patterns in crypto tradingChart patterns are shapes formed by price movements that help traders anticipate future market trends. These patterns fall into two main categories: reversal patterns, which signal that a current trend may change direction, and continuation patterns, which suggest the trend will likely resume after a brief pause. They stem from market psychology, where emotions like fear, greed and uncertainty drive collective trading behavior and create recognizable shapes on charts.Here are five common patterns every crypto investor, including beginners, should know:1. Head and shouldersThe head-and-shoulders pattern features three peaks, with a higher middle peak (the head) between two smaller ones (the shoulders), all connected by a “neckline.” The inverse version indicates a potential bullish reversal.How to read: A decline in volume on the right shoulder signals weakening momentum. A price break below the neckline confirms a bearish reversal, while a break above it confirms a bullish inverse. Measure the distance from the head to the neckline, then project that distance from the breakout point to estimate the target move.Stop-loss: Place it above the right shoulder for bearish setups or below it for bullish ones.Example: This pattern often appears during altcoin corrections after major hype cycles, such as following a token’s listing on a major exchange like Binance. In early 2025, Cardano (ADA) formed a head-and-shoulders pattern during a correction phase after its governance upgrade buzz, signaling a temporary bearish move.2. Double top and double bottomDouble tops form an “M” shape near resistance, signaling a potential bearish reversal. Double bottoms form a “W” shape near support, signaling a potential bullish reversal.How to read: These patterns show two failed attempts to break resistance (top) or support (bottom). Confirmation occurs when the price crosses the neckline: bearish for double tops and bullish for double bottoms. Measure the height from the neckline to the peaks or troughs, then project it from the breakout point to estimate the move.Stop-loss: Place it above the top peaks or below the bottom troughs.Example: This pattern often appears in memecoin pump-and-dumps. For instance, Dogecoin (DOGE) formed a double top in mid-2025 after a social media-driven surge, followed by a sharp correction.3. TriangleTriangle patterns form when price movements create converging trendlines, resulting in a triangular shape. The three main types are ascending (bullish), descending (bearish) and symmetrical (neutral).How to read: Breakouts often follow the existing trend but can occasionally reverse it. Estimate the price target by measuring the base width of the triangle and projecting it from the breakout point. A breakout upward in an uptrend is typically bullish, while a breakdown in a downtrend is bearish. To avoid false signals, use a 1%-2% filter before confirming a move.Stop-loss: Place it below the triangle for bullish setups or above it for bearish ones.Example: During periods of market uncertainty, asset charts often display triangle formations. In early 2025, Ether’s (ETH) price action formed a symmetrical triangle amid uncertainty surrounding decentralized finance (DeFi) regulations. The price later broke out bullishly as regulatory clarity improved.4. Flag and pennantFlag and pennant patterns form after sharp price moves. Flags appear as small, parallel channels, while pennants look like compact triangles. Both signal brief pauses before the prevailing trend continues.How to read: A steep “pole” followed by a short consolidation suggests that the trend is likely to resume. These patterns are bullish in uptrends and bearish in downtrends. Traders often enter on a pullback within the flag or pennant to improve risk-reward.Stop-loss: Place it below the flag or pennant’s low for bullish setups, or above the high for bearish ones.Example: During bullish market phases, tokens often display flag or pennant formations. In 2025, Solana’s (SOL) price action formed a bullish flag pattern amid rapid ecosystem growth, including new DeFi protocol launches. This setup signaled the continuation of its upward trend.5. WedgeWedge patterns form when price action creates converging trendlines that slope either upward (rising wedge, typically bearish) or downward (falling wedge, typically bullish).How to read: A rising wedge in an uptrend often signals a potential reversal as momentum weakens, while a falling wedge in a downtrend points to a possible bullish reversal. These patterns can also act as continuation signals when aligned with the prevailing trend. Measure the wedge’s height and project it from the breakout point to estimate the target move.Stop-loss: Place it outside the wedge’s opposite trendline.Example: Wedge patterns can help identify potential market tops during overheated conditions. In 2025, during a period of heightened speculation, Arbitrum’s (ARB) price action formed a rising wedge pattern, which was later followed by a market correction.Did you know? Many crypto traders prefer logarithmic charts over linear ones. While linear scales display absolute price changes, log scales highlight percentage changes, making it easier to compare Bitcoin’s early rise from $1 to $10 with its later move from $10,000 to $20,000, both representing 10x growth.Complementary tools and indicators for trend analysisTo strengthen your trend analysis, you can use several key indicators and tools. Important indicators include:Moving averages (SMA/EMA crossovers): Track trends by watching when a short-term exponential moving average (EMA) crosses above or below a long-term simple moving average (SMA). The EMA gives more weight to recent price data, allowing it to respond faster to market changes, while the SMA calculates the average closing price over a selected period for a smoother view of the overall trend.Relative Strength Index (RSI): Detects overbought (>70) or oversold (prevents traders from chasing rallies or exiting too early during corrections.Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD): Uses a histogram to identify momentum shifts when the MACD line crosses the signal line. A widening gap between the two often indicates strengthening momentum.Bollinger Bands: Track volatility squeezes to spot potential breakouts or reversals. When the price breaks above or below the bands, it signals an upcoming move. Narrowing bands suggest consolidation, often followed by sharp price swings.Volume analysis: Volume spikes confirm market participation during breakouts or reversals, validating chart patterns. Declining volume during a trend can signal weakening momentum.Did you know? Volume bars are more than background visuals. They confirm whether price breakouts are trustworthy. A surge in volume during a breakout signals strong market participation, while low volume may warn of a false move. Many traders view volume as the “heartbeat” of chart analysis.Risk management and best practicesSuccessful crypto trading relies on strong risk management and disciplined methods. Avoid analyzing patterns in isolation: Instead, combine chart patterns with indicators (such as RSI) and relevant news to improve accuracy. Always risk only a small portion of your capital to protect against sudden market volatility.From a psychological standpoint, resisting fear of missing out (FOMO) is essential in 2025’s AI-driven environment, where automated trading and social media can easily inflate asset prices. Stay grounded, avoid hype and remain committed to your strategy.Common mistakes include falling for false breakouts without volume confirmation and overtrading on short timeframes, which can lead to mental fatigue. To strengthen your approach, consider backtesting: applying your trading strategy to historical data to evaluate its past performance and potential future profitability.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
