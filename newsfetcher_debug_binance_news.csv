The study cautions that these experts may have misinterpreted the true state of the labor market. If the report's conclusions are accurate, it suggests that the Federal Reserve could make a significant error by reducing interest rates too quickly while inflation remains high. This traditional understanding of the employment market is flawed, as it fails to consider the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's stringent measures against illegal immigration. Since the current administration took office, at least 300,000 immigrants have ""voluntarily departed,"" affecting the labor market, alongside the impact of all forcibly deported immigrants. The analysis also indicates a significant reversal from the situation a few years ago when large numbers of immigrants were entering the United States."
